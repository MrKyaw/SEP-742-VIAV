The Mobility Guided Intelligent Information Assistant (MGIIA)

The Mobility Guided Intelligent Information Assistant (MGIIA) is an advanced system designed to enhance road safety in autonomous vehicles by providing hands-free, real-time safety tips through visual perception and AI-powered analysis. Utilizing LLAMA Vision Models, the system processes video feeds from vehicle cameras to perform multiple object detection, image segmentation, and video-to-frame conversion, enabling it to identify key road elements such as pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles. Through image understanding and information extraction, MGIA continuously monitors the driving environment to assess hazards and safety risks.

Incorporating GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs), the assistant generates real-time, hands-free safety tips, such as warnings about nearby obstacles, lane deviations, or changes in traffic conditions, delivered through voice or visual cues. The systemâ€™s multimodal GenAI capabilities combine visual, auditory, and sensor data to create a seamless user experience, ensuring that drivers are always informed without distraction. VGA also leverages road safety information to suggest safe driving practices, such as speed adjustments or collision avoidance strategies. The open-source nature of the project ensures that the system is adaptable, transparent, and continually improvable, fostering innovation in autonomous vehic
le safety.
